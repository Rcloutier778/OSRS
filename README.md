# OSRS
Developed on/off between 2017 and 2019 for some alts.
To be used by my main, but chickened out and kept it on alts. 

OSRS bot designed to be as safe as possible, by simulating someone playing IRL to the best of its ability. 
This means not clicking the same spot over and over, not instantly reacting to events, delayed reactions, occasionally going AFK, etc. 

Uses Jython and SikuliX image recognition to do **stuff**. 
Heavy emphasis on randomness, such as in click area, human-like reaction times, etc.
