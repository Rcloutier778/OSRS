# OSRS
Developed on/off between 2017 and 2019 for some alts.

OSRS bot designed to be as safe as possible, to be used by my main, but chickened out and kept it on alts. 

Uses Jython and SikuliX image recognition to do **stuff**. 
Heavy emphasis on randomness, such as in click area, human-like reaction times, etc. 

#NeverBanned lmao
